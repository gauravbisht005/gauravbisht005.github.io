                                    First 2 lectures, LAB [FCPC (Fundamentals of Computing & Programming in C)] followed with M1 (Mathematics-1) and P1 (Physics-1)... Welcome to Computer Science Engineering</p>
                                    <p align="justify">First officially - unofficial introduction of any freshie with his/her college seniors happens in the Freshers.<br>
                                    <strong>24th Sep, 2017 (Sunday) - after a month - Freshers!!</strong><br>
                                    I still remember till date. It was a rainy day and no matter how much people love rains, I'm an ardent opposition to those! It just makes a good day worse and how can one love it!!?
                                    Keeping my hatred for rainy season aside, I still attended the event (my dad dropped me off! [Can't thank him enough for everything he does - To the undoubted superheroes without a cape.. 'a sincere and humble gratitude']).
                                    Well I had developed friendships with a few within a month (and I believed me to be an introvert :P I guess we all wanted to make new friendships and everything fell into places as if it was a game of Tetris)</p>

                                    <p align="justify"><strong>Month 5</strong>"Education without an exam is incomplete to judge" you on how much you've learnt exactly" # Within quotation marks to make you know, you know!!<br>
                                    We used to have our exams for almost 2 months (including internals and externals). So, our first college exams were held from November to December comprising of Internal Practicals, External Practicals, Internal Theory Exams and concluding with External Theory Exams.
                                    The examinations have always been tricky. For most of the students, external factors have always had an impact on how much you'll be scoring rather than your actual knowledge in any particular field of subject; starting from your roll number (who's sitting in-front and behind you), be it your desk placed on the first of the row,
                                    the invigilator in-charge, the season in which the examination is being held, mood of the teacher checking your answer sheet based on those fellow classmates whose roll number used to come before you.... 
                                    But as said... Tetris, you ought to make every piece settle and eventually our exams concluded successfully and here's a small celebration:
